| Method                  | Definition                                                                                     | Real-Time Use Case                                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                                             |

| **`Promise.all`**       | Waits for all promises to resolve or rejects if any promise is rejected.                       | When you need all tasks to be completed before proceeding (e.g., loading multiple images on a webpage).   | Waiting for all products in an Amazon cart to be available for purchase; if any item is unavailable, the checkout fails.                                            |
| **`Promise.race`**      | Resolves or rejects as soon as any of the promises in the array resolves or rejects.            | When you need the result of the fastest promise (e.g., getting the quickest response from multiple servers). | You want the fastest delivery option for your Amazon order, regardless of whether it's from a local or international seller; you go with the fastest one.           |
| **`Promise.allSettled`**| Waits for all promises to settle (either resolve or reject) and returns an array of their results. | When you need the results of all tasks, regardless of whether they succeed or fail (e.g., loading images, ignoring errors). | Fetching the status of all products in your Amazon wishlist, even if some are unavailable; shows which ones can be bought and which ones are out of stock.           |
| **`Promise.any`**       | Resolves as soon as any promise resolves or rejects if all promises are rejected.               | When you need at least one task to succeed (e.g., getting data from any server).                                                                | Buying any available item in a limited-stock Amazon sale; you get the first item that is available without waiting for all items to be checked.                     |
