# JavaScript Variables
- Variables in JavaScript can be declared using var, let, or const. The main differences are:

1. var: Function-scoped or globally scoped, and can be re-declared and updated.
2. let: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared within the same block, but can be updated.
3. const: Block-scoped, cannot be re-declared or updated after its initial declaration.
   
# Variable Naming Rules
- Must start with: A letter, underscore _, or dollar sign $.
- Can contain: Letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Cannot start with: A digit.
- Case-Sensitive: myVariable and myvariable are treated as different variables.
- Reserved Keywords: Cannot use reserved JavaScript keywords as variable names (e.g., var, function, return).
